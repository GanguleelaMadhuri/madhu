RUN the free command and display as
1. Total memory = 
2. used memory =
3. Free memory =
Task 1 : run the free command and display output as
        Total memory = 
        used memory
1.  =
        Free memory =
Task 2 : Compare used and free memory and display which one is bigger
Task 3 : check how much swap memory is available and see if it is more than total memory 

Answer:
total=$(free -m | grep Mem | cut -c 17-20)
echo 1.Total memory = $total
used=$(free -m | grep Mem | cut -c 29-31)
echo 2.Used memory = $used
avl=$(free -m | grep Mem | cut -c 76-79)
echo 3.Free memory = $avl

echo Task 2
fr=$(free -m | grep Mem | cut -c 41-44)
#echo $fr
if [ $used -ge $fr ]
then
echo "More  memory has been used"
else
echo "There are more free place in memory comparing to used memory"
fi

echo Task 3
swap=$(free -m | grep Swap | cut -c 17-20)
echo Swap memory available = $swap
if (( $swap > $total ))
then
echo Swap memory crossed the total memory.
else
echo More total memory
fi

free -m
